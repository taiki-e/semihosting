//! Owned and borrowed Unix-like file descriptors.
//!
//! This is identical to [`std::os::fd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/fd/index.html),
//! but available with no-std.
//!
//! Note that this crate does not provide `{As,Into,From}RawFd` traits. They have been effectively
//! obsoleted by io-safety, and now using `AsFd`, `From<... > for OwnedFd`, or `Into<OwnedFd>`
//! is recommended. To convert to `RawFd`, you need first convert it to `BorrowedFd` or
//! `OwnedFd` the above way and then call `BorrowedFd::as_raw_fd` or `OwnedFd::{as,into}_raw_fd`.
//! This redundancy is intentional, as it serves as a reminder that it is usually not
//! recommended.
